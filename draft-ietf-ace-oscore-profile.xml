      <t>
        This document specifies a profile of the ACE framework <xref target="I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz"/>.  In this profile, a client and a resource server use the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) <xref target="RFC7252"/> to communicate.  The client uses an access token, bound to a symmetric key (the proof-of-possession key) to authorize its access to the resource server.  Note that this profile uses a symmetric-crypto-based scheme, where the symmetric secret is used as input material for keying material derivation.  In order to provide communication security and proof of possession, the client and resource server use Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE) <xref target="RFC8613"/>.  Note that the proof of possession is not achieved through a dedicated protocol element, but rather occurs after the first message exchange using OSCORE.
      </t>

      <t>
        OSCORE specifies how to use CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) <xref target="RFC8152"/> to secure CoAP messages.
        Note that OSCORE can be used to secure CoAP messages, as well as HTTP and combinations of HTTP and CoAP; a profile of ACE similar to the one described in this document, with the difference of using HTTP instead of CoAP as communication protocol, could be specified analogously to this one.
      </t>

      <section anchor="terminology" title=" Terminology">

        <t>
          The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
      "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
      described in BCP 14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/> when, and only when, they
      appear in all capitals, as shown here.
        </t>

        <t>
          Certain security-related terms such as "authentication", "authorization", "confidentiality", "(data) integrity", "message  authentication code", and "verify" are taken from <xref target="RFC4949"/>.
        </t>

        <t>
          RESTful terminology follows HTTP <xref target="RFC7231"/>.
        </t>

        <t>
          Readers are expected to be familiar with the terms and concepts defined in OSCORE <xref target="RFC8613"/>, such as "Security Context" and "Recipient ID".
        </t>

        <t>
          Terminology for entities in the architecture is defined in OAuth 2.0 <xref target="RFC6749"/>, such as client (C), resource server (RS), and authorization server (AS). It is assumed in this document that a given resource on a specific RS is associated to a unique AS.
        </t>

        <t>
          Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) <xref target="RFC8949"/> and Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL) <xref target="RFC8610"/> are used in this document. CDDL predefined type names, especially bstr for CBOR byte strings and tstr for CBOR text strings, are used extensively in this document.
        </t>

        <t>
          Note that the term "endpoint" is used here, as in <xref target="I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz"/>, following its OAuth definition, which is to denote resources such as token and introspect at the AS and authz-info at the RS.  The CoAP <xref target="RFC7252"/> definition, which is "An entity participating in the CoAP protocol" is not used in this document.
        </t>

    <section title="Protocol Overview"> 
    
      <t>
        This section gives an overview of how to use the ACE Framework <xref target="I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz"/> to secure the communication between a client and a resource server using OSCORE <xref target="RFC8613"/>. The parameters needed by the client to negotiate the use of this profile with the authorization server, as well as the OSCORE setup process, are described in detail in the following sections.
      </t>

      <t>
        The RS maintains a collection of OSCORE Security Contexts with associated authorization information for all the clients that it is communicating with. The
        authorization information is maintained as policy that is used as input to processing requests from those clients.  
      </t>

      <t>
        This profile requires a client to retrieve an access token from the AS for the resource it wants to access on an RS, by sending an access token request to the token endpoint, as specified in section 5.8 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz"/>. The access token request and response MUST be confidentiality-protected and ensure authenticity.  This profile RECOMMENDS the use of OSCORE between client and AS, to reduce the number of libraries the client has to support, but other protocols fulfilling the security requirements defined in section 5 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz"/> (such as TLS <xref target="RFC8446"/> or DTLS <xref target="I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13"/>) MAY be used as well.
      </t>

      <t>
        Once the client has retrieved the access token, it generates a nonce N1, defined in this document (see <xref target="nonce1"/>). The client also generates its own OSCORE Recipient ID ID1 (see Section 3.1 of <xref target="RFC8613"/>), for use with the keying material associated to the RS. The client posts the token, N1 and its Recipient ID to the RS using the authz-info endpoint and mechanisms specified in section 5.8 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz"/> and Content-Format = application/ace+cbor. When using this profile, the communication with the authz-info endpoint is not protected, except for update of access rights.
      </t>

      <t>
        If the access token is valid, the RS replies to this request with a 2.01 (Created) response with Content-Format = application/ace+cbor, which contains a nonce N2 and its newly generated OSCORE Recipient ID, ID2, for use with the keying material associated to the client. Moreover, the server concatenates the input salt received in the token, N1, and N2 to obtain the Master Salt of the OSCORE Security Context (see section 3 of <xref target="RFC8613"/>).
        The RS then derives the complete Security Context associated with the received token from the Master Salt, the OSCORE Recipient ID generated by the client (set as its OSCORE Sender ID), its own OSCORE Recipient ID, plus the parameters received in the access token from the AS, following section 3.2 of <xref target="RFC8613"/>.
      </t>

      <t>
        In a similar way, after receiving the nonce N2, the client concatenates the input salt, N1 and N2 to obtain the Master Salt of the OSCORE Security Context. The client then derives the complete Security Context from the Master Salt, the OSCORE Recipient ID generated by the RS (set as its OSCORE Sender ID), its own OSCORE Recipient ID, plus the parameters received from the AS.
      </t>

      <t>
        Finally, the client starts the communication with the RS by sending a request protected with OSCORE to the RS. If the request is successfully verified, the server stores the complete Security Context state that is ready for use in protecting messages, and uses it in the response, and in further communications with the client, until token deletion, due to e.g. expiration. This Security Context is discarded when a token (whether the same or a different one) is used to successfully derive a new Security Context for that client. 
      </t>

      <t>
        The use of nonces N1 and N2 during the exchange prevents the reuse of an
        Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) nonce/key pair
        for two different messages. Reuse might otherwise occur when
        client and RS derive a new Security Context from an existing (non-
        expired) access token, as might occur when either party has just rebooted, and might lead to loss of both confidentiality and integrity.
        Instead, by using the exchanged nonces N1 and N2 as part of the Master Salt, the request to the authz-info endpoint posting the same token results in a different Security Context, by OSCORE construction, since even though the Master Secret, Sender ID and Recipient ID are the same, the Master Salt is different (see Section 3.2.1 of <xref target="RFC8613"/>). If the exchanged nonces were reused, a node reusing a non-expired old token would be susceptible to on-path attackers provoking the creation of an OSCORE message using an old AEAD key and nonce.
      </t>

      <t>
        After the whole message exchange has taken place, the client can contact the AS to request an update of its access rights, sending a similar request to the token endpoint that also includes an identifier so that the AS can find the correct OSCORE security input material it has previously shared with the client. This specific identifier, encoded as a byte string, is assigned by the AS to be unique in the sets of its OSCORE security input materials, and is not used as input material to derive the full OSCORE Security Context.
      </t>

      <t>
        An overview of the profile flow for the OSCORE profile is given in <xref target="prof-overview"/>. The names of messages coincide with those of <xref target="I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz"/> when applicable.

      <t>
        The following subsections describe the details of the POST request and response to the token endpoint between client and AS. Section 3.2 of <xref target="RFC8613"/> defines how to derive a Security Context based on a shared master secret and a set of other parameters, established between client and server, which the client receives from the AS in this exchange.  The proof-of-possession key (pop-key) included in the response from the AS MUST be used as master secret in OSCORE.

          The client must send this POST request to the token endpoint over a secure channel that guarantees authentication, message integrity and confidentiality (see <xref target="introsp"/>).

          If the client wants to update its access rights without changing an existing OSCORE Security Context, it MUST include in its POST request to the token endpoint a req_cnf object, with the kid field carrying a CBOR byte string containing the OSCORE Input Material Identifier (assigned as discussed in <xref target="as-c"/>). This identifier, together with other information such as audience (see Section 5.8.1 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz"/>), can be used by the AS to determine the shared secret bound to the proof-of-possession token and therefore MUST identify a symmetric key that was previously generated by the AS as a shared secret for the communication between the client and the RS. The AS MUST verify that the received value identifies a proof-of-possession key that has previously been issued to the requesting client. If that is not the case, the Client-to-AS request MUST be declined with the error code 'invalid_request' as defined in Section 5.8.3 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz"/>.

        <t>
          After verifying the POST request to the token endpoint and that the client is authorized to obtain an access token corresponding to its access token request, the AS responds as defined in section 5.8.2 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz"/>. If the client request was invalid, or not authorized, the AS returns an error response as described in section 5.8.3 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz"/>.
        </t>

        <t>
          The AS can signal that the use of OSCORE is REQUIRED for a specific access token by including the "ace_profile" parameter with the value "coap_oscore" in the access token response.  This means that the client MUST use OSCORE towards all resource servers for which this access token is valid, and follow <xref target="oscore-setup"/> to derive the security context to run OSCORE.
Usually it is assumed that constrained devices will be pre-configured with the necessary profile, so that this kind of profile signaling can be omitted.	  
        </t>

        <t>
          Moreover, the AS MUST send the following data:
        </t>

        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>a master secret</t>
            <t>an identifier of the OSCORE Input Material</t>
          </list>
        </t>

        <t>
          Additionally, the AS MAY send the following data, in the same response. 
        </t>

        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>a context identifier</t>

            <t>the OSCORE version number</t>
          </list>
        </t>

        <t>
          This data is transported in the OSCORE_Input_Material. The OSCORE_Input_Material is a CBOR map object, defined in <xref target="oscore-sec-ctx"/>. This object is transported in the 'cnf' parameter of the access token response as defined in Section 3.2 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-params"/>, as the value of a field named 'osc', registered in <xref target="osc-cwt"/> and <xref target="osc-jwt"/>.
        </t>

        <t>
          The AS MAY assign an identifier to the context (context identifier). This identifier is used as ID Context in the OSCORE context as described in section 3.1 of <xref target="RFC8613"/>. If assigned, this parameters MUST be communicated as the 'contextId' field in the OSCORE_Input_Material. The application needs to consider that this identifier is sent in the clear and may reveal information about the endpoints, as mentioned in section 12.8 of <xref target="RFC8613"/>.
        </t>

          The master secret and the identifier of the OSCORE_Input_Material MUST be communicated as the 'ms' and 'id' field in the 'osc' field in the 'cnf' parameter of the access token response.
          If included, the AEAD algorithm is sent in the 'alg' parameter in the OSCORE_Input_Material; the HKDF algorithm in the 'hkdf' parameter of the OSCORE_Input_Material; a salt in the 'salt' parameter of the OSCORE_Input_Material; and the OSCORE version in the 'version' parameter of the OSCORE_Input_Material.

        	The same parameters MUST be included in the claims associated with the access token.
          The OSCORE master secret MUST be encrypted by the authorization server so that only the resource server can decrypt it (see Section 6.1. of <xref target="I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz"/>). This profile RECOMMENDS the use of CBOR web token (CWT) protected with COSE_Encrypt/COSE_Encrypt0 as specified in  <xref target="RFC8392"/>.

          The AS MUST send different OSCORE_Input_Material (and therefore different access tokens) to different authorized clients, in order for the RS to differentiate between clients.

            An OSCORE_Input_Material is an object that represents the input material to derive an OSCORE Security Context, i.e., the local set of information elements necessary to carry out the cryptographic operations in OSCORE (Section 3.1 of <xref target="RFC8613"/>). In particular, the OSCORE_Input_Material is defined to be serialized and transported between nodes, as specified by this document, but can also be used by other specifications if needed. The OSCORE_Input_Material can either be encoded as a JSON object or as a CBOR map. The set of common parameters that can appear in an OSCORE_Input_Material can be found in the IANA "OSCORE Security Context Parameters" registry (<xref target="sec-ctx-params-reg"/>), defined for extensibility, and is specified below.
            All parameters are optional.
            <xref target="key-labels"/> provides a summary of the OSCORE_Input_Material parameters defined in this section.

    <section anchor="c-rs1" title="Client-RS Communication">

      <t>
        The following subsections describe the details of the POST request and response to the authz-info endpoint between client and RS. The client generates a nonce N1 and an identifier ID1 unique in the sets of its own Recipient IDs, and posts them together with the token that includes the materials (e.g., OSCORE parameters) received from the AS to the RS. The RS then generates a nonce N2 and an identifier ID2 unique in the sets of its own Recipient IDs, and uses Section 3.2 of <xref target="RFC8613"/> to derive a security context based on a shared master secret, the two exchanged nonces and the two identifiers, established between client and server. The exchanged nonces and identifiers are encoded as CBOR byte string if CBOR is used, and as Base64 string if JSON is used. This security context is used to protect all future communication between client and RS using OSCORE, as long as the access token is valid.
      </t>

<!--      <t>
        Note that the proof-of-possession required to bind the access token to the
        client is implicitly performed by generating the shared OSCORE Security Context using
        the pop-key as master secret, for both client and RS.  An attacker
        using a stolen token will not be able to generate a valid OSCORE context and
        thus not be able to prove possession of the pop-key.
      </t> -->

      <t>
        Note that the RS and client authenticate each other
        by generating the shared OSCORE Security Context using
        the pop-key as master secret.  An attacker
        posting a valid token to the RS will not be able to generate a valid OSCORE Security Context and
        thus not be able to prove possession of the pop-key. Additionally, the mutual authentication is only achieved after the client has successfully verified a response from the RS protected with the generated OSCORE Security Context.
      </t>


      <section anchor="c-rs" title="C-to-RS: POST to authz-info endpoint">

        <t>
          The client MUST generate a nonce value N1 very unlikely to have been previously used with the same input keying material. This profile RECOMMENDS to use a 64-bit long random number as nonce's value. The client MUST store the nonce N1 as long as the response from the RS is not received and the access token related to it is still valid (to the best of the client's knowledge).
        </t>

        <t>
          The client generates its own Recipient ID, ID1, for the OSCORE Security Context that it is establishing with the RS. By generating its own Recipient ID, the client makes sure that it does not collide with any of its Recipient IDs, nor with any other identifier ID1 if the client is executing this exchange with a different RS at the same time.
        </t>

        <t>
          The client MUST use CoAP and the Authorization Information resource as described in section 5.8.1 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz"/> to transport the token, N1 and ID1 to the RS.
        </t>

        <t>
           Note that the use of the payload and the Content-Format is different from what is described in section 5.8.1 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz"/>, which only transports the token without any CBOR wrapping. In this profile, the client MUST wrap the token, N1 and ID1 in a CBOR map. The client MUST use the Content-Format "application/ace+cbor" defined in section 8.14 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz"/>. The client MUST include the access token using the 'access_token' parameter, N1 using the 'nonce1' parameter defined in <xref target="nonce1"/>, and ID1 using the 'ace_client_recipientid' parameter defined in <xref target="id1"/>.

        <t>
          The communication with the authz-info endpoint does not have to be protected, except for the update of access rights case described below.
        </t>

        <t>
          Note that a client may be required to re-POST the access token in order to complete a request, since an RS may delete a stored access token (and associated Security Context) at any time, for example due to all storage space being consumed. This situation is detected by the client when it receives an AS Request Creation Hints response. Reposting the same access token will result in deriving a new OSCORE Security Context to be used with the RS, as different exchanged nonces will be used.
        </t>

        <t>
          The client may also choose to re-POST the access token in order to renew its OSCORE Security Context. In that case, the client and the RS will exchange newly generated nonces, re-negotiate identifiers, and derive new keying material. The client and RS might decide to keep the same identifiers or renew them during the re-negotiation.

          If the client has already posted a valid token, has already established a security association with the RS, and wants to update its access rights, the client can do so by posting the new token (retrieved from the AS and containing the update of access rights) to the /authz-info endpoint. The client MUST protect the request using the OSCORE Security Context established during the first token exchange. The client MUST only send the 'access_token' field in the CBOR map in the payload, no nonce or identifier are sent.

          The RS MUST follow the procedures defined in section 5.8.1 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz"/>: the RS must verify the validity of the token. If the token is valid, the RS must respond to the POST request with 2.01 (Created). If the token is valid but is associated to claims that the RS cannot process (e.g., an unknown scope), or if any of the expected parameters is missing (e.g., any of the mandatory parameters from the AS or the identifier 'id1'), or if any parameters received in the 'osc' field is unrecognized, the RS must respond with an error response code equivalent to the CoAP code 4.00 (Bad Request). In the latter two cases, the RS may provide additional information in the error response, in order to clarify what went wrong.
          The RS may make an introspection request (see Section 5.9.1 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz"/>) to validate the token before responding to the POST request to the authz-info endpoint.

        <t>
          Additionally, the RS MUST generate a nonce N2 very unlikely to have been previously used with the same input keying material, and its own Recipient ID, ID2. The RS makes sure that ID2 does not collide with any of its Recipient IDs. The RS MUST ensure that ID2 is different from the value received in the ace_client_recipientid parameter. The RS sends N2 and ID2 within the 2.01 (Created) response. The payload of the 2.01 (Created) response MUST be a CBOR map containing the 'nonce2' parameter defined in <xref target="nonce2"/>, set to N2, and the 'ace_server_recipientid' parameter defined in <xref target="id2"/>, set to ID2. This profile RECOMMENDS to use a 64-bit long random number as nonce's value.

        <t>
          If the RS receives the token in a OSCORE protected message, it means that the client is requesting an update of access rights. The RS MUST ignore any nonce and identifiers in the request, if any was sent. The RS MUST check that the "kid" of the 'cnf' claim of the new access token matches the identifier of the OSCORE Input Material of the context used to protect the message. If that is the case, the RS MUST overwrite the old token and associate the new token to the Security Context identified by the "kid" value in the 'cnf' claim. The RS MUST respond with a 2.01 (Created) response protected with the same Security Context, with no payload. If any verification fails, the RS MUST respond with a 4.01 (Unauthorized) error response.

        <t>
          As specified in section 5.8.1 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz"/>, when receiving an updated access token with updated authorization information from the client (see <xref target="c-as"/>), it is recommended that the RS overwrites the previous token, that is only the latest authorization information in the token received by the RS is valid.

In case an optional parameter is omitted, the default value SHALL be used as described in sections 3.2 and 5.4 of <xref target="RFC8613"/>. After that, the client MUST derive the complete Security Context following section 3.2.1 of <xref target="RFC8613"/>.

          After sending the 2.01 (Created) response, the RS MUST set the Master Salt of the Security Context created to communicate with the client to the concatenation of salt, N1, and N2, in the same way described above. An example of Master Salt construction using CBOR encoding is given in <xref target="ms-ex" /> and using Base64 encoding is given in <xref target="ms-ex-2" />.

          The RS then uses this Security Context to verify requests and send responses to the client using OSCORE. If OSCORE verification fails, error responses are used, as specified in section 8 of <xref target="RFC8613"/>. Additionally, if OSCORE verification succeeds, the verification of access rights is performed as described in section <xref target="tok-ver"/>. The RS MUST NOT use the Security Context after the related token has expired, and MUST respond with a unprotected 4.01 (Unauthorized) error message to
requests received that correspond to a Security Context with an expired
token.

          Note that the ID Context can be assigned by the AS, communicated and set in both the RS and client after the exchange specified in this profile is executed. Subsequently, client and RS can update their ID Context by running a mechanism such as the one defined in Appendix B.2 of <xref target="RFC8613"/> if they both support it and are configured to do so. In that case, the ID Context in the OSCORE Security Context will not match the "contextId" parameter of the corresponding OSCORE_Input_Material.
          Running Appendix B.2 results in the keying material in the Security Contexts of client and RS being updated; this same result can also be achieved by the client reposting the access token to the unprotected /authz-info endpoint at the RS, as described in <xref target="c-rs"/>, but without updating the ID Context.

      <t>
        There are a number of scenarios where a client or RS needs to discard the OSCORE security context, and acquire a new one.
      </t>

      <t>
        The client MUST discard the current Security Context associated with an RS when any of the following occurs:
      </t>

      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t> the Sequence Number space ends. </t>
          <t> the access token associated with the context becomes invalid, due to e.g. expiration. </t>
          <t> the client receives a number of 4.01 Unauthorized responses to OSCORE requests using the same Security Context. The exact number needs to be specified by the application. </t>
          <t> the client receives a new nonce in the 2.01 (Created) response (see <xref target="rs-c"/>) to a POST request to the authz-info endpoint, when re-posting a (non-expired) token associated to the existing context. </t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>
        The RS MUST discard the current Security Context associated with a client when any of the following occurs:
      </t>

      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t> the Sequence Number space ends. </t>
          <t> the access token associated with the context expires. </t>
          <t> the client has successfully replaced the current security context with a newer one by posting an access token to the unprotected /authz-info endpoint at the RS, e.g., by re-posting the same token, as specified in <xref target="c-rs"/>.</t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>
        Whenever one more access token is successfully posted to the RS, and a new Security Context is derived between the client and RS, messages in transit that were protected with the previous Security Context might not pass verification, as the old context is discarded. That means that messages sent shortly before the client posts one more access token to the RS might not successfully reach the destination. Analogously, implementations may want to cancel CoAP observations at the RS registered before the Security Context is replaced, or conversely they will need to implement a mechanism to ensure that those observation are to be protected with the newly derived Security Context.

      <t>
        This document specifies a profile for the Authentication and
        Authorization for Constrained Environments (ACE) framework
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz"/>.  Thus the general security
        considerations from the framework also apply to this profile.
      </t>

      <t>
        Furthermore the general security considerations of OSCORE <xref
        target="RFC8613"/> also apply to this specific
        use of the OSCORE protocol.
      </t>

      <t>
        As previously stated, the proof-of-possession in this profile is performed by both parties verifying that they have established the same Security Context, as specified in <xref target="oscore-setup"/>, which means that both the OSCORE request and OSCORE response pass verification.
        RS authentication requires both that the client trusts the AS and that the OSCORE response from the RS pass verification.
      </t>
      
      <t>
        OSCORE is designed to secure point-to-point communication,
        providing a secure binding between the request and the response(s).
        Thus the basic OSCORE protocol is not intended for use in
        point-to-multipoint communication (e.g., multicast, publish-subscribe).
        Implementers of this profile should make sure that their use case
        corresponds to the expected use of OSCORE, to prevent weakening the
        security assurances provided by OSCORE.
      </t>
      
      <t>
        Since the use of nonces N1 and N2 during the exchange guarantees uniqueness of AEAD keys and nonces, it is REQUIRED that the exchanged nonces are not reused with the same input keying material even in case of re-boots. This document RECOMMENDS the exchange of 64 bit random nonces. Considering the birthday paradox, the average collision for each nonce will happen after 2^32 messages, which is considerably more token provisioned than would be expected for intended applications. If applications use something else, such as a counter, they need to guarantee that reboot and loss of state on either node does not provoke reuse.
        If that is not guaranteed, nodes are susceptible to reuse of AEAD (nonce, key) pairs, especially since an on-path attacker can cause the use of a previously exchanged client nonce N1 for Security Context establishment by replaying the corresponding client-to-server message.
      </t>

      <t>
        This profile RECOMMENDS that the RS maintains a single access token for each client. The use of multiple access tokens for a single client increases the strain on the resource server as it must consider every access token and calculate the actual permissions of the client. Also, tokens indicating different or disjoint permissions from each other may lead the server to enforce wrong permissions. If one of the access tokens expires earlier than others, the resulting permissions may offer insufficient protection. Developers SHOULD avoid using multiple access tokens for a same client. 
      </t>

      <t>
        If a single OSCORE Input Material is used with multiple RSs, the RSs can impersonate the client to one of the other RS, and impersonate another RS to the client. If a master secret is used with several clients, the clients can impersonate RS to one of the other clients. Similarly if symmetric keys are used to integrity protect the token between AS and RS and the token can be used with multiple RSs, the RSs can impersonate AS to one of the other RS. If the token key is used for any other communication between the RSs and AS, the RSs can impersonate each other to the AS.

      	An unprotected response to an unauthorized request may disclose information about the resource server and/or its existing relationship with the client.

        The token is sent in the clear to the authz-info endpoint, so if a client uses the same single token from multiple locations with multiple Resource Servers, it can risk being tracked by the token's value even when the access token is encrypted.
      </t>

       <t>
        The nonces exchanged in the request and response to the authz-info endpoint are also sent in the clear, so using random nonces is best for privacy (as opposed to, e.g., a counter, that might leak some information about the client).
      </t>

      <t>
        The identifiers used in OSCORE, negotiated between client and RS are privacy sensitive (see Section 12.8 of <xref target="RFC8613"/>), and could reveal information about the client, or may be used for correlating requests from one client.
      </t>

      <t>
      	Note that some information might still leak after OSCORE is established, due to observable message sizes, the source, and the destination addresses.

      <section title="Expert Review Instructions" anchor="review">
        <t>
          The IANA registry established in this document is defined to use the Expert Review registration policy.
          This section gives some general guidelines for what the experts should be looking for, but they are being designated as experts for a reason so they should be given substantial latitude.
        </t>

        <t>
          Expert reviewers should take into consideration the following points:

          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              Point squatting should be discouraged.
              Reviewers are encouraged to get sufficient information for registration requests to ensure that the usage is not going to duplicate one that is already registered and that the point is likely to be used in deployments.
              The zones tagged as private use are intended for testing purposes and closed environments. Code points in other ranges should not be assigned for testing.
            </t>

            <t>
              Specifications are required for the standards track range of point assignment.
              Specifications should exist for specification required ranges, but early assignment before a specification is available is considered to be permissible.
              Specifications are needed for the first-come, first-serve range if they are expected to be used outside of closed environments in an interoperable way.
              When specifications are not provided, the description provided needs to have sufficient information to identify what the point is being used for.
            </t>

            <t>
              Experts should take into account the expected usage of fields when approving point assignment.
              The fact that there is a range for standards track documents does not mean that a standards track document cannot have points assigned outside of that range.
              The length of the encoded value should be weighed against how many code points of that length are left, the size of device it will be used on, and the number of code points left that encode to that size.
            </t>
